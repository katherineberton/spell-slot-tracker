3. make a new table with char_id, slot level, used reflecting current day
1. figure out how to deal with sorting
2. add a filter to get all spells
4. how to reflect this on the dom - at the point of use, give that item a state -spell deets
    at the point of use, add to slots table
    at the point of clearing, clear the state?
5. how many slots should populate? should it be all of them but with display = none?
    or should the num populated be subject to the class and level rules?
6. add rogues
7. maybe add "spells used today" to the session, and just change the slot component to say "USED" when used
