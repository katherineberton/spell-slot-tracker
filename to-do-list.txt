add arcane trickster rogue to classes

fix warlock short rest logic - right now it adds a full set of new slots,
instead of re-upping slots to max slots. so if a warlock only used one
before their short rest and had max 2 at a time, they'd short rest and
end up with 3 total available.

fix the css on the add cantrip modal on the landing page - it does not
scroll with the viewport. this is low priority because this will really
only apply to people who have so many characters that they need to scroll
down to see all of them.

flesh out the multiclassing system to accommodate warlock multiclassing.
    change db architecture to give each slot a "type", warlock or caster
    add a new association table that will allow one character to have 
        multiple classes, and add a levels column to this table
    change the logic in the server to generate two sets of blank slots -
        warlock and regular caster - on a long rest for a character that
        has both

encrypt passwords

alter the spell casting modal to only display spells of the selected slot
or higher. right now all spells are in the drop down box

implement spells known for classes that don't have to prepare spells, and
prepared spells for classes that know their whole list but have to prepare
    this could get weird with warlock multiclassing again.

research a different API or data source to accommodate the full spell list
